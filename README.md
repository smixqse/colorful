# colorful
let your discord server be colorful.

includes:
- automatic detection of color roles
- silent use when the bot doesn't have permission to talk
- color detection from user profile picture

requires node and npm.
to use locally, put all the files in a folder, use `npm install`, change the options on `config.json` as you prefer, create a file named `.env`, copy the contents on `env` and add your bot token after `TOKEN=`. then use `node server.js` to make your bot online.
